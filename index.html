        <h1>What do we know about a croissant?</h1>
        <article class="article">
            <p>
                A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry
                inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the
                French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named
                for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with
                butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
                rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The
                process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff
                pastry.</p>
            <p>Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
                crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity but using
                brioche dough. Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and
                French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern croissant was
                developed in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced
                the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated
                dough. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made,
                frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food
                that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant
                bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French
                response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40%
                of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were
                baked from frozen dough.</p>

            <p>Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many
                European countries.
